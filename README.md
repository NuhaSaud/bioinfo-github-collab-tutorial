## What is Git and Why Do We Need It?

### What is Version Control?
Think of version control as a **"time machine"** for your files. Just like you might save different versions of a document as:
- `Protocol_v1.docx`
- `Protocol_v2_final.docx` 
- `Protocol_v2_final_REAL.docx`

Git does this automatically and much more efficiently!

### Why Bioinformatics Researchers Need Git:
- 📄 **Track changes** in analysis protocols, documentation, and data files
- 🤝 **Collaborate** with team members on research projects
- 💾 **Backup** your work automatically
- 🔄 **Restore** previous versions if something breaks
- 📝 **Document** what you did and when you did it

### Real-World Bioinformatics Examples:
- Sharing analysis protocols between lab members
- Tracking changes to experimental procedures
- Collaborating on grant proposals and papers
- Managing data analysis documentation
- Version controlling bioinformatics workflows

## SSH Authentication Setup (Recommended)

### Why Use SSH Instead of HTTPS?

#### HTTPS Authentication:
- ❌ Requires username/password or token every time
- ❌ Tokens expire and need renewal
- ❌ Less secure for frequent use

#### SSH Authentication:
- ✅ **One-time setup** - no repeated authentication
- ✅ **More secure** - uses cryptographic keys
- ✅ **Faster operations** - no credential prompts
- ✅ **Professional standard** - used by developers worldwide

### Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys

First, let's see if you already have SSH keys:

#### Windows (Git Bash):
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

#### Mac/Linux (Terminal):
```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

**Look for these files:**
- `id_rsa` or `id_ed25519` (private key)
- `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub` (public key)

If you see these files, you can skip to [Step 3: Add SSH Key to GitHub](#step-3-add-ssh-key-to-github).

### Step 2: Generate New SSH Key

#### Method A: Using Ed25519 (Recommended - More Secure)
```bash
# Replace with your GitHub email
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@university.edu"
```

#### Method B: Using RSA (If Ed25519 not supported)
```bash
# Replace with your GitHub email  
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@university.edu"
```

**You'll see prompts like this:**
```
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/yourusername/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```

**Press Enter** to accept default location.

```
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

**Options:**
- **With passphrase** (recommended): Extra security, but you'll need to enter it occasionally
- **Without passphrase**: More convenient, slightly less secure

**Press Enter twice** if you want no passphrase, or enter a secure passphrase.

### Step 3: Add SSH Key to GitHub

#### Copy Your Public Key

**Windows (Git Bash):**
```bash
# For Ed25519 key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# OR for RSA key
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

**Mac:**
```bash
# For Ed25519 key
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# OR for RSA key  
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# For Ed25519 key
xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# OR for RSA key
xclip -selection clipboard < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

#### Add to GitHub

1. **Go to GitHub** → Click your profile picture → **Settings**
2. **Click "SSH and GPG keys"** in left sidebar
3. **Click "New SSH key"**
4. **Title**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Lab Computer", "Personal Laptop")
5. **Key type**: Keep "Authentication Key"
6. **Key**: Paste your copied public key
7. **Click "Add SSH key"**
8. **Enter your GitHub password** to confirm

### Step 4: Test SSH Connection

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

**First time, you'll see:**
```
The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

**Type `yes`** and press Enter.

**Success looks like:**
```
Hi yourusername! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### Step 5: Configure Repositories to Use SSH

#### For New Repositories:
When cloning, use SSH URL instead of HTTPS:

```bash
# SSH format (use this)
git clone git@github.com:username/repository-name.git

# Instead of HTTPS format
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

#### For Existing Repositories:
Convert existing repos from HTTPS to SSH:

```bash
# Check current remote
git remote -v

# Change to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository-name.git

# Verify the change
git remote -v
```

### Step 6: SSH Agent Setup (Optional but Recommended)

If you used a passphrase, set up SSH agent to remember it:

#### Windows (Git Bash):
```bash
# Start ssh-agent
eval $(ssh-agent -s)

# Add your key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  # or id_rsa
```

#### Mac:
```bash
# Start ssh-agent  
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add to keychain (remembers passphrase)
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  # or id_rsa
```

#### Linux:
```bash
# Start ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  # or id_rsa
```

### SSH Tool Integration

#### GitHub Desktop with SSH
GitHub Desktop automatically uses SSH if:
1. You've set up SSH keys (follow steps above)
2. Your repository is configured for SSH
3. You're signed into GitHub Desktop

#### VSCode with SSH
VSCode uses your system's Git configuration:
1. **Ensure SSH is set up** (follow steps above)
2. **Clone using SSH URL** when prompted
3. **Or convert existing repos:**
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - "Git: Remote Set URL"
   - Enter SSH URL: `git@github.com:username/repo.git`

#### Command Line with SSH
Once SSH is configured, all Git commands work the same:
```bash
# Clone (using SSH)
git clone git@github.com:username/bioinfo-protocols.git

# Normal workflow
cd bioinfo-protocols
git pull                    # No password needed!
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add new protocol"
git push                    # No password needed!
```

### SSH Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Problem: "Permission denied (publickey)"

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check remote URL format
git remote -v
# Should show: git@github.com:username/repo.git

# If HTTPS, change to SSH:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

# Test SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

#### Problem: SSH prompts for passphrase every time

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Add to SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# For Mac users (permanent keychain storage):
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### SSH Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Generate SSH key | `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@university.edu"` |
| Display public key | `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` |
| Test SSH connection | `ssh -T git@github.com` |
| Add key to SSH agent | `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` |
| Change repo to SSH | `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:user/repo.git` |

**💡 Tip**: Once SSH is set up, you'll never need to enter passwords for Git operations again!

## Essential Git Concepts

### Repository (Repo)
A folder that Git tracks. Contains:
- Your files (protocols, data, documentation)
- Hidden `.git` folder (Git's tracking information)

### Commit
A snapshot of your files at a specific time. Like clicking "Save" but with a description of what you changed.

**Good commit messages for bioinformatics:**
- ✅ "Add PCR protocol for COI amplification"
- ✅ "Fix primer sequences in protocol"
- ✅ "Update sample collection procedure"
- ❌ "Changed stuff"
- ❌ "Updates"

### Branch
A parallel version of your project. Useful for:
- Testing new protocols
- Collaborating on different sections
- Experimenting without breaking the main version

**Common branch names:**
- `main` - Your stable, tested version
- `draft-manuscript` - Working on a paper
- `protocol-updates` - Improving procedures
- `data-analysis` - Adding analysis methods

### Remote
The online copy of your repository (usually on GitHub). Allows:
- Backup of your work
- Sharing with collaborators
- Access from multiple computers

### Clone vs Fork

#### Clone
Making a copy of someone's repository to your computer
```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/bioinfo-protocols.git
```

#### Fork
Making your own copy of someone's repository on GitHub (for contributing to open science projects)

- [ ] Centrifuge (≥12,000 RCF)
- [ ] Micropipettes (10-1000 μL)
- [ ] Vortex mixer
- [ ] Liquid nitrogen dewar

## 📋 Step-by-Step Protocol

### Pre-Protocol Preparation (30 min)
1. **Heat CTAB buffer** to 60°C in water bath
2. **Chill materials**:
   - Mortars and pestles in -20°C freezer
   - Centrifuge to 4°C  
   - Chloroform:isoamyl alcohol on ice
3. **Label all tubes** with sample IDs and date

### Sample Preparation (45 min)
#### Step 1: Tissue Collection
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Work quickly to prevent DNA degradation
```

1. **Collect 100-200mg fresh tissue**
   - Young leaves for best results
   - Avoid flowers or woody material
   - ⏱️ **Timing**: Within 1 hour of collection

2. **Flash freeze immediately**
   - Submerge in liquid nitrogen 30 seconds
   - Transfer to -80°C if storing (up to 6 months)

<!-- TODO: Add photos of proper tissue collection -->

#### Step 2: Tissue Disruption
1. **Pre-chill equipment**
   - Place mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen
   - Allow 2-3 minutes for thermal equilibration

2. **Grind tissue to powder**
   - Add tissue to pre-chilled mortar
   - Grind with circular motions
   - Continue until fine powder (3-5 minutes)
   - ⚠️ **Critical**: Keep tissue frozen throughout

### DNA Extraction (2 hours)

#### Step 3: CTAB Treatment
1. **Transfer powder to tube**
   - Use pre-chilled spatula
   - Add directly to 2mL microcentrifuge tube

2. **Add CTAB buffer**
   - Volume: 800μL pre-heated CTAB buffer (60°C)
   - Mix immediately by gentle inversion
   - ⏱️ **Timing**: Use buffer within 5 minutes of heating

3. **Incubate with mixing**
   - Temperature: 60°C water bath
   - Duration: 60 minutes
   - **Mix every 15 minutes** by gentle inversion (5x)

<!-- FIXME: Verify optimal incubation time with recent literature -->

#### Step 4: Phase Separation
1. **Cool to room temperature** (5 minutes)

2. **Add chloroform:isoamyl alcohol**
   - Volume: 800μL (equal volume to CTAB buffer)
   - ⚠️ **Safety**: Work in chemical hood
   - Mix by gentle inversion (20x over 2 minutes)

3. **Centrifuge for separation**
   - Speed: 12,000 RCF
   - Duration: 15 minutes  
   - Temperature: 4°C

#### Step 5: DNA Recovery
1. **Transfer aqueous phase**
   - Carefully pipette upper aqueous layer
   - Volume: ~600-700μL (don't disturb interface)
   - Transfer to new labeled tube

2. **Precipitate DNA**
   - Add 0.6 volumes cold isopropanol (~400μL)
   - Mix gently by inversion (10x)
   - Incubate -20°C for 30 minutes (or overnight)

3. **Pellet DNA**
   - Centrifuge 12,000 RCF, 15 minutes, 4°C
   - You should see small white pellet

#### Step 6: DNA Washing and Resuspension
1. **Wash pellet**
   - Remove supernatant carefully (don't disturb pellet)
   - Add 500μL cold 70% ethanol
   - Centrifuge 12,000 RCF, 5 minutes, 4°C

2. **Dry pellet**
   - Remove all ethanol with pipette
   - Air dry 5-10 minutes (don't over-dry)
   - Pellet should be translucent, not white

3. **Resuspend DNA**
   - Add 50-100μL TE buffer (pH 8.0)
   - Incubate 4°C overnight for complete dissolution
   - Store long-term at -20°C

## ✅ Quality Control

### Quantification Methods
1. **NanoDrop Spectrophotometer**:
   - Expected concentration: 50-200 ng/μL
   - A260/A280 ratio: 1.8-2.0 (pure DNA)
   - A260/A230 ratio: 2.0-2.2 (no contamination)

2. **Fluorometric quantification** (Qubit):
   - More accurate for PCR applications
   - Use dsDNA High Sensitivity assay

### Quality Assessment
1. **Agarose gel electrophoresis**:
   - 0.8% agarose gel
   - Load 5μL DNA + 1μL loading dye
   - High molecular weight band indicates intact DNA
   - Smearing suggests degradation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Low yield (<10 ng/μL)** | Insufficient starting material | Increase tissue amount to 200mg |
| | Old tissue samples | Use fresh tissue within 1 hour |
| | Buffer too cold during extraction | Ensure CTAB buffer stays at 60°C |
| **Brown/dark coloration** | Polyphenol oxidation | Add 2% PVP to CTAB buffer |
| | Tissue from woody plants | Use young leaf tissue only |
| **Low A260/A280 ratio (<1.6)** | Protein contamination | Repeat chloroform extraction |
| | Incomplete lysis | Extend CTAB incubation to 90 min |
| **DNA degradation (smearing)** | Over-grinding tissue | Reduce grinding time |
| | Nuclease activity | Ensure all equipment is nuclease-free |

• 40-50°C: T. aquaticus dominant (8/12 samples)
• 50-65°C: Mixed Thermus/Aquifex (15/20 samples)  
• 65-80°C: T. thermophilus + novel species (6/10 samples)
• >80°C: Mostly uncultured organisms (4/6 samples)
```

### pH Tolerance Patterns
- **Neutral pH (6.5-7.5)**: Traditional thermophiles
- **Alkaline pH (8.0-9.5)**: Novel alkalithermophiles  
- **Extreme alkaline (>9.5)**: Unidentified organisms

## 🚨 Quality Concerns and Follow-up

### Samples Requiring Re-analysis
<!-- FIXME: These samples had technical issues -->

| Sample | Issue | Resolution |
|---------|-------|------------|
| YS-F-001| Low quality sequence | Re-sequence with new primers |
| YS-F-007 | Possible contamination | Re-extract DNA, repeat PCR |
| YS-F-012 | Chimeric sequence | Use chimera detection tools |

### Database Limitations
- Many thermal spring organisms remain uncultured
- GenBank bias toward model organisms
- Need specialized thermophile databases

## Troubleshooting Common Issues in VSCode

### Problem 1: VSCode Not Showing Git Changes

#### Symptoms:
- Source Control panel empty
- No file modification indicators
- Git operations not working

#### VSCode-Specific Solutions:

**Check Git Repository Status:**
1. **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → "Git: Show Git Output"
2. Look for error messages in Git output panel

**Reinitialize Git in VSCode:**
```bash
# In VSCode terminal (Ctrl+`)
cd your-project-folder
git status  # Check if in Git repo
ls -la      # Look for .git folder
```

**VSCode Settings Check:**
1. **File** → **Preferences** → **Settings**
2. Search for "git.enabled" 
3. Ensure it's set to `true`
4. Check "git.path" points to correct Git installation

**Quick Fixes:**
```json
// In .vscode/settings.json
{
    "git.enabled": true,
    "git.decorations.enabled": true,
    "git.autorefresh": true
}
```

### Problem 2: Authentication Issues in VSCode

#### HTTPS Token Problems:

**VSCode Credential Manager:**
1. **Command Palette** → "Git: Clone"
2. When prompted for credentials:
   - Username: Your GitHub username
   - Password: Personal Access Token (not your password!)

**Update Stored Credentials:**
1. **Windows**: Control Panel → Credential Manager → Windows Credentials
2. **Mac**: Keychain Access → GitHub entries → Update
3. **Linux**: 
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

#### SSH Setup for VSCode:

**Test SSH in VSCode Terminal:**
```bash
# Open terminal in VSCode (Ctrl+`)
ssh -T git@github.com
```

**Convert Repository to SSH:**
1. **Command Palette** → "Git: Remote Set URL"
2. Enter SSH URL: `git@github.com:username/repo.git`
3. **Or use terminal:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
   ```

### Problem 3: Merge Conflicts in VSCode

#### VSCode Merge Conflict Interface:

**Visual Conflict Resolution:**
1. **Conflicted files** show with `!C` indicator
2. **Click the file** to open merge editor
3. **VSCode shows**:
   - **Current Change** (your changes)
   - **Incoming Change** (others' changes)  
   - **Result** (combined result)

**Resolution Options:**
- **Accept Current Change**
- **Accept Incoming Change**  
- **Accept Both Changes**
- **Ignore**
- **Edit manually**

**Step-by-Step Resolution:**
```markdown
## In conflict file, you'll see:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your version of the text
=======
Their version of the text  
>>>>>>> branch-name

## VSCode provides clickable options above each section:
Accept Current Change | Accept Incoming Change | Accept Both Changes...
```

**After Resolving:**
1. **Stage resolved files**: Click `+` in Source Control
2. **Commit**: Write merge commit message
3. **Push**: Sync changes

#### Advanced Merge Tools in VSCode:

**Install GitLens for Better Conflict Resolution:**
1. **Extensions** → Search "GitLens"
2. **Features unlocked**:
   - Line-by-line history
   - Blame annotations  
   - Better diff views
   - File history comparison

### Problem 4: Large Files and Performance

#### .gitignore Configuration in VSCode:

**Create .gitignore:**
1. **Right-click** in Explorer → **New File** → `.gitignore`
2. **Use template** for bioinformatics projects:

```bash
# .gitignore for Bioinformatics Projects

## Large Data Files
*.fastq
*.fastq.gz
*.fasta.gz
*.fasta
*.fa
*.bam
*.sam
*.vcf
*.vcf.gz

## Documentation builds
docs/_build/
site/
```

**VSCode Features for .gitignore:**
1. **File Association**: VSCode recognizes `.gitignore` syntax
2. **IntelliSense**: Autocomplete for common patterns
3. **Extensions**: "gitignore" extension provides templates

#### Git LFS Integration in VSCode:

**For Large Files That Must Be Tracked:**
```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Track specific file types
git lfs track "*.fastq.gz"
git lfs track "*.bam"

# Add .gitattributes to repository
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Configure Git LFS for large files"
```

### Problem 5: Branch Management Issues

#### VSCode Branch Operations:

**Branch Switching Problems:**
1. **Uncommitted changes**: 
   - VSCode prompts to commit or stash
   - **Stash**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Git: Stash"
   - **Commit**: Stage and commit in Source Control

2. **Branch not appearing**:
   - **Fetch**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Git: Fetch"  
   - **Refresh**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Git: Refresh"

**Create Branch from Specific Commit:**
1. **GitLens Graph View**: Shows visual commit history
2. **Right-click commit** → "Create Branch from Commit"
3. **Or Command Palette**: "Git: Create Branch From..."

### Problem 6: VSCode Git Extension Issues

#### Reset Git Extensions:

**Disable/Re-enable Git:**
1. **Command Palette** → "Developer: Reload Window"
2. **Extensions** → Find Git-related extensions
3. **Disable** → **Enable** → **Reload**

**Check Git Path:**
```json
// Settings.json
{
    "git.path": "/usr/bin/git",  // Linux/Mac
    "git.path": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe"  // Windows
}
```

#### Common Extension Conflicts:

**Conflicting Extensions:**
- Multiple Git extensions can conflict
- **Disable unnecessary ones**:
  - Git History vs GitLens (choose one)
  - Multiple GitHub extensions

**Reset VSCode Git State:**
```bash
# Close VSCode completely
# Delete VSCode workspace settings
rm -rf .vscode/
# Reopen and reconfigure
```

### Problem 7: Performance Issues with Large Repositories

#### VSCode Optimization for Large Repos:

```json
// .vscode/settings.json for performance
{
    "git.decorations.enabled": false,
    "git.autorefresh": false,  
    "search.useIgnoreFiles": true,
    "search.exclude": {
        "**/data/**": true,
        "**/results/**": true,
        "**/*.fastq": true,
        "**/*.bam": true
    },
    "files.watcherExclude": {
        "**/data/**": true,
        "**/results/**": true
    }
}
```

**Exclude Large Directories from VSCode:**
1. **Settings** → **Files: Watcher Exclude**
2. **Add patterns** for data directories
3. **Restart VSCode** for changes to take effect
